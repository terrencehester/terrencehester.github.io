<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
<h2>Industrial Truck Association Brandon </h2>
<p>Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. We've engineered the H Series forklifts to be the best at both. To counter this trend and the associated challenges for the driver and reach truck, Linde has developed features such as Dynamic Mast Control to compensate for mast oscillation, introduced numerous measures to optimize visibility, and incorporated load displays.</p>

We'll make an offer on lift trucks in any condition. We are specialists in quality forklift equipment, forklift sales, forklift rentals, and on-site repairs of forklifts.

Drive and operate your rental equipment safely. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in which employees are in close proximity to forklifts in operation, food-processing and healthcare sectors.</p>

Their lift trucks start at 2,500 lbs weight lifts and go upwards of 125,000.

We offer proper service, timely response, reasonable pricing, proper control, and quality work. Electric forklifts are cheaper to operate as they cost less for fuel, require lower maintenance (having fewer moving parts), need less replacement of fluids and have considerably fewer lost hours from maintenance downtime and breakdown.</p>
