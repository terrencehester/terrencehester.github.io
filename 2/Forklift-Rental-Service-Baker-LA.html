<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

<p>Whether it is while the order picker is moving up and down or during driving, the operator's entire body remains safely within the confines of the truck - aided, among other things, by compact steering and a generous cab area. 27"W x 48"L forks feature entry rollers and tapered design for easy pallet and skid entry, and are reinforced for heavy duty loads.</p>
