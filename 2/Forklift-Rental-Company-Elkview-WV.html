<p>116 Effective Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training Program Four major areas of concern must be addressed:  The general hazards that apply to the operation of all or most powered industrial trucks;  The hazards associated with the operation of particular types of trucks;  The hazards of workplaces generally; and,  The hazards of the particular workplace where the vehicle operates.</p>
<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. At a minimum, you should have a card or certificate of proof of training and the vehicle load charts (and attachment load charts as well, if applicable) on the jobsite—OSHA will look for these items first.
