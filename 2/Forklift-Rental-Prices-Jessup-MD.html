<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>The forklift's overhead guard will quickly pin or crush a jumping operator. There are two different ways that lift kits are designed, which dictates how they are installed and each one lifts the truck in a different way. We are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient product of our company.</p>
