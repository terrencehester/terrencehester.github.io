The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Telescopic forward reach allows you to unload lorries from one side so no forklift movement around the other side of the lorry is required, ensuring pedestrians stay safe and separate.

Lifted trucks from respected companies like Rocky Ridge are the best option since they have experience and numerous positive reviews.</p>
