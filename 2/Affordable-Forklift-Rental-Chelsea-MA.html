<p>For more information on lift kits, contact us at Sour Lake Ford in Sour Lake, TX. We're here to make customizing your Ford truck as easy and painless as possible. This includes a Multimatic DSSV damping system on the off-road suspension, which allows for a smooth and surprisingly comfortable ride on even the roughest trails. It can lift a 4,000 ft payload up to 21 ft in the air.</p>
<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
