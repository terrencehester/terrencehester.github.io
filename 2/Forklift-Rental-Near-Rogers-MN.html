H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years. MARCOM's Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks training has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>

<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Forklifts are designed and manufactured deliberately unbalanced. Typically the billing cycle for a forklift rental is monthly, but daily billing or weekly billing is available depending on the rental period and requirements of the renter.
