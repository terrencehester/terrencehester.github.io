Distribution centers, warehouses, stock yards, construction companies all have a use for this popular forklift type.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>

<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.

<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>I appreciate the informative post and pictures you have shared of different types of forklifts. This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks.
