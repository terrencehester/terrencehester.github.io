<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking.

<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>

And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
