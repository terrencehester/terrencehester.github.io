Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can.

If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>

More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup.
