<p>If your service crew is already busy with the rest of your equipment, don't load them up with even more equipment to maintain. The lift truck market value and volume are contributed by the revenue and the forklift truck units sold across North America, Asia Pacific, Middle-East Africa and Latin America. If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>
