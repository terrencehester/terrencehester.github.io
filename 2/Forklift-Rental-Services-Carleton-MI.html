We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks. As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach‚Äù into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>Often, this is not as easy to accomplish with the transmission or transfer case side of the driveshaft, and your U-joint-style driveshaft is best tossed for a custom unit, using a double cardan or CV joint that can run smoothly at higher angles. Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>
