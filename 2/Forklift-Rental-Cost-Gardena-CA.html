We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town. Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials.</p>

Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>

Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well.

<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet.
