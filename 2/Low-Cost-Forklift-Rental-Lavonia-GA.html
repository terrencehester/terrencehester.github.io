<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that there are no set rules for exactly how much a used forklift should price, and a whole lot will also depend on the demand and supply of used forklifts in your town. Generally speaking the reach truck will be less expensive new, used or leased than a sit-down forklift but the real value is in increased warehouse productivity. At United Equipment, we offer a wide range of Cat and Elevah order pickers for sale, the ideal pickers for high, narrow or tricky-to-navigate spaces.</p>
