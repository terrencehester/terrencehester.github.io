<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Whether tough outdoor use or classic stacking in the warehouse; whether pallet truck, order picker or narrow aisle truck; if you need to move a few hundredweight or several tons - at Jungheinrich Rental you always get the right truck. In order to ensure quality, these pallet trucks are stringently tested on several parameters by Our qualified experts. We are your source for the best daily, weekly, or monthly prices on rentals including Cat, Hyster, and Toyota brands.</p>

<p>But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts. The North American electric truck market grew 6%, whereas the IC market was down 5%. The IC decline was almost entirely centered on Class 4, indoor cushion tire equipment, which fell 11% as Class 5 remained flat. Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
<p>Many warehouses and similar operations only need specific equipment at certain times of the year. Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental. Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it.</p>

The Rental Department of Raymond Storage Concepts strives to provide quality equipment and solutions to your short and long-term rental needs. The answer is similar to electric forklifts above. A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>
