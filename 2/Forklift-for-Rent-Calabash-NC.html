<h2>Powered Industrial Lift Truck Operator (Forklift) Calabash </h2>
<p>The sense of rotation of the control handle is intended to be in the same direction as the desired motion of the mast or load.

<p>Citation needed Unlike standard counterbalance and reach forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.

Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
