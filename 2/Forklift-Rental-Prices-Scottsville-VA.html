<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to consider about how your truck will change after it's lifted.

The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>

Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle. Additionally, the report enlists several leading companies that have generated substantial Forklift Trucks Market revenue in recent years and forecasts the companies that are likely to emerge leading in the coming years.</p>
