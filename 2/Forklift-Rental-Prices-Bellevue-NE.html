<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>This package has standard off-road wheels, but a 4-inch performance lift-kit and slim line fenders. Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks. In addition to their smaller design, a reach forklift's cargo is lifted back within the wheelbase, enabling a smaller profile even when fully loaded.</p>

<p>These sit-down rough terrain forklifts have all been checked upon purchase to determine that they are in good working order. The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required.

The forklift manufacturer makes valves and hose routing accessories, but the parts and labor to install can be prohibitively expensive.</p>

Unauthorized personnel shall not be permitted to ride on powered industrial trucks. RICO's Pegasus counterbalance forklift series redefines material handling with our four wheel sit-down truck.</p>

<p>The answers are also important for you to choose the correct forklift attachments to do the job at hand.

<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking. Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift.
