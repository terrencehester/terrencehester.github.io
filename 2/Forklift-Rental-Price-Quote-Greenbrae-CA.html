Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet‚Äù forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
<p>Layman's Terms: The panhard bar is a vital ingredient when lifting a truck, it helps the suspension not to twist and cause excessive body roll. Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications. With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>
