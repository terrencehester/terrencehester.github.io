<p>Steering, braking, accelerating and all the nuances of driving will change once the shape of the truck has changed, so be prepared for an all-new ride after completing a suspension lift.

Again, it largely will depend on the nature of your business, your warehouse size and specifically what you intend to use the forklift for.
