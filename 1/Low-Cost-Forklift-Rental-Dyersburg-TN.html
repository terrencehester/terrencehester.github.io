Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>22. 22 Performance-Oriented Requirements  The powered industrial truck operator training requirements are performance-oriented to permit employers to tailor a training program to the characteristics of their workplaces and the particular types of powered industrial trucks operated.

Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other. When not in use, pallet jacks should be rolled into an area that does not have pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>Also, note that loads longer than 48” will extend your load center beyond the standard rating of a 24” load center. This is among a very good quality pallet truck with great durability and support. Call to discuss load types and warehouse limitations for your safety and accuracy. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelves—it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side. Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well.

There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
