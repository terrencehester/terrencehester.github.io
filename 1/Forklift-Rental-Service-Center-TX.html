Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs, you may find that a pallet jack is the best fit for your warehouse or product. These trucks like most of our products come up with the option of customization. Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks. If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls.</p>

Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
