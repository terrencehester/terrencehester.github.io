The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle. If you have any other questions about counterbalance or reach forklifts or would like any advice regarding finding the ideal forklift for you, then please contact PHL today We offer support and have a huge range of stock to suit your every need.</p>

<p>While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these. In addition to mapping out a safe route for the pallet jack, the worker should make certain that the equipment will not be overloaded.
