<p>RT forklifts are ideal for smaller jobsites, due to it's lower cost and maneuverability. Constructed to fit in narrow aisle spaces, a forklift maneuvers around crowded warehouses with ease.

Lifted truck up-fits are either for utility, such as enhancing your truck's capabilities and performance, or to improve its appearance. A lifted body and large tires give you a domineering stance on the road.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
