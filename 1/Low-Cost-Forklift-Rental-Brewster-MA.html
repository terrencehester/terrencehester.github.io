We specialize in new and used warehouse forklifts to include narrow aisle reach trucks, pneumatic tire and cushion tire forklifts , order pickers and electric and manual pallet jacks. IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks.</p>

The two basic types of lift kit are body lift and suspension lift. It should be noted that Lifted Trucks do have their drawbacks. Industrial lift truck is defined in regulation as: a self-propelled vehicle used to carry, lift, stack, tier, push or pull material.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks.

The lifting forks rise up to 31.5 inches, which saves the operator unnecessary bending and heavy lifting and increases efficiency in repetitive handling operations.

<p>So turn to Tynan, Indiana's largest forklift rental fleet, when you need to borrow a lift.

In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
