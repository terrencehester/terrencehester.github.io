<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Parts & Service - Our forklift parts and service departments are ready at a moments notice and can repair any brand of equipment in your fleet. Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility.

It may be tempting to buy one of the lifted trucks for sale in Phoenix without test driving it. But don't do it.

<p>The Forklift Network has 170 dealers across North America including Canadian Provinces, and has thousands of used electric forklifts for sale. The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it. The name comes from the counterweight in the rear of the vehicle.

Raymond's Furniture Orderpicker Truck is specifically designed for furniture handling needs. Customized solutions for special work requirements ensure that trucks are operated very cost-effectively in specific areas such as handling of bulky loads.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. Use these machines to tackle residential or commercial landscaping jobs. 2. Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>
<p>It will allow you to efficiently pick goods on a pallet and quickly move from rack to rack as well as give you the ability to drive the lifter into a container in order to unload goods. Forklifts come in many sizes, shapes, colors and functions. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift. Its stabilized legs and forward extending forks enables this warehouse truck to extend upwards to reach racks that are usually too high for a standard forklift.</p>
<p>Our rental fleet - supplemented by over 5,000 lift trucks in Raymond's national network - is regularly updated with new equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications. Our powered pallet trucks are easy to manoeuvre with load capacities up to 3t, perfect for material handling operations. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards.</p>
