<p>Suitable for indoor horizontal transportation and stacking, such as in warehouses, distribution centers and logistics companies, the Toyota range of powerful reach trucks offers high acceleration and exceptional drivability for optimum pallet movement.

Regardless of the brand name, you should expect to find an engine capable of at least 74 to 78 hp on the lower end (straight mast forklifts) and up to 142 hp on the high end (encompassing telehandlers with extended reach capability).</p>
<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material.

Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift. Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
