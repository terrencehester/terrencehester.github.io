<p>Our AC Orderpicker trucks use fewer amps per cycle, so you'll save on batteries, chargers and downtime. First and foremost, it is important to understand the different types of lift kits. We are the leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet to optimise battery performance and shift life.</p>
<p>Engine power is often a critical component of buying a rough terrain forklift.
