<p>The trucks make light work of heavy loads, while the scales impress with their outstanding precision. The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.

This is ideal if you have multiple loads in one bay that you can access from different angles, as the truck can grab loads further back.</p>
<h2>Used Reach Truck Jenkintown</h2>

This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>

<p>I found the right forklift on Damoli's website and just ordered it over the phone. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit.
