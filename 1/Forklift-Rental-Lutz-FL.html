<p>Order picker forklifts are usually powered by electric motors because they don't generate noxious fumes.

<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard.

One of the very nicely-designed pallet trucks to see is this Big Joe Pallet.
