H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach‚Äù into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

<p>It should be noted that you can equip your forklift with a camera to provide a pallet POV improve that view, though ask yourself this: Would you rather watch a football game on the 50-yard line, or on a 15-in. Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights. The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
<p>Often one or more of these three types of reach trucks are used in warehouses. The result is a smarter, more scalable fleet of reach trucks. For 4-wheel internal combustion forklifts, options and accessories include mini-lever controls with an armrest that can be adjusted in three ways, an LPG swing-down bracket which can lower the bracket 65 degrees from the horizontal position, and a steering wheel knob that can make driving the lift more efficient.</p>

Best for: Toyota's electric order picker is ideal for many types of operations and industries including: warehouse order picking, and Third Party Logistics (3PL) companies with square footage over 10,000 square feet.</p>
