Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials.</p>

<h2>Fork Truck Manufacturers Waukesha</h2>
<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing.
